This game was built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The game involves two players on a race to accrue 100 points. The first player to score a 100 points wins the game.

A player rolls a dice continuously, and the numbers gotten from the dice roll is added to the point of the current player. The player loses their turn when they get a 1 (which makes the player lose all their current score), or when they hold their current scores (which is added to their total scores).
